## Welcome to my technical skill portfolio 🛠️💡😊

This is where I house all my _(audience-friendly)_ practice projects and case studies. 
The majority of my work in SQL and Python is produced with an aim of demonstrating _developing_-skills in various aspects of data, particulary data engineering.

Please note: the tasks and datasets likely originate either from _DataCamp_’s various courses, _Udemy_ bootcamps, or various code-alongs available online from tech companies (eg. _IBM_, _Google_, _Snowflake_) and general _YouTube_ content.

Below is an overview of the various projects that can be found, and the skills (commented on the right-side) they look to demonstrate.
